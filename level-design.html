        I explored theoretical and practical approaches to designing compelling game levels. 
        This involved breaking down the spatial structure of levels into Molecular Drawings and Detailed Maps to establish flow, challenge balance, and player experience.

    <h3>Level Design Process: Molecular Design to Detailed Maps</h3>
    <p>
        <b>How I design Molecular Drawnings: <br></b>
        In my work, I always listen to the requirements of the gameplay designer and understand the vibe of the game before I start to draw an abstract representation of the level. <br>
        I breakdown my level into zones or segments, each representing a gameplay encounter, tutorial, or challenge. 
        These segments are connected by arrows that define flow and progression. <br> <br>

        <b>From Molecular Drawnings to Detailed Maps: <br></b>
        From conceptual drawings, I transition to detailed maps by defining spatial and environmental details. This includes: <br>
        -Geometry and architecture of the level <br>
        -Enemy and NPC placements <br>
        -Traversal Elements <br>
        -Environmental Storytelling <br>
