            Onboarding System: I created a sequence of onboarding instructions that help players understand key mechanics, 
            such as using the Spacebar to advance the onboarding, and providing key gameplay tips like sprinting, 
            interacting with the environment, and avoiding spam messages.

                Gameplay Mechanics: Implemented Player Movement and Interaction Mechanics. <br>

                    -Walking into areas push pop-ups onto your screen. <br>
                    -The more pop-ups, the slower the player can move (WASD). <br>
                    -Use the mouse or press the correct key to close pop-up ads <br>
