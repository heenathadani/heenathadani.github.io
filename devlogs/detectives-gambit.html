        <p style="font-size: 20px;">In the Murder Mystery Card-Battler project, I focused extensively on UI/UX design and gameplay mechanics. 
            My key contributions included:
            
            <li style = "font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">UI/UX Design: 
                I created reference designs in Figma for various game screens, including menus, in-game interfaces, and character information. 
                I finalized the UI for critical game components like the journal and card battler, ensuring a cohesive and accessible user experience.

            <li style = "font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Card-Battler Design: 
                I helped in defining the card battler mechanics. 
                I worked on the 3-lane questioning system and designed how the game’s UI would reflect the player’s progress.

                </div>
                
            </li>
            <br>

            <li style = "font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Scene Management and Navigation: 
                I made significant progress in developing the scene management system in Unity, 
                enabling smooth transitions between different screens and exploration areas.
            </li>
            <br>

            <li style = "font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Playtesting and Bug Fixes: 
                I took on the task of resolving UI bugs post-playtesting, 
                including fixing card battler UI elements and ensuring the playtest feedback was incorporated. 
                I also worked on adding a notification feature to the journal and ensuring that UI transitions, 
                like the door system between scenes, worked seamlessly.
            </li>
            <br>
            I tried to ensure that the game’s user interface was not only functional but also engaging and intuitive, 
            contributing to the overall immersive experience of the Murder Mystery Card-Battler game.</p>
