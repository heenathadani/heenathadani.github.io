        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            A remake of the original Highway Rider in UE is an exciting attempt at creating a racing game 
            that puts players in the driver's seat of a high-speed motorcycle. 
            The game mechanics of Highway Rider are straightforward. 
            The core objective of the player is to cross-timed checkpoints while crossing obstacles between them.
            The game consists of simple controls to move through the screen, and WASD/Arrow Keys to move. 

            The project was designed and developed in UE5 using Blueprints, 
            fulfilling the requirements of the final project for IGME 797: Advanced Topics in Game Development.

        <h2>Processes, Reflections, & References</h2>
        <p> As part of this project, I used blueprints to achieve my desired goals. 
        The work was divided into two parts: the level design and the gameplay programming.
        The level design was focused on creating a visually appealing environment for the player to drive through.
        The gameplay programming was focused on creating the core mechanics of the game, such as the player's movement and the obstacles they would face.
        The project was inspired by the original Highway Rider game, which was developed by Battery Acid Games.
