        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            A remake of the original Highway Rider in UE is an exciting attempt at creating a racing game 
            that puts players in the driver's seat of a high-speed motorcycle. 
            The game mechanics of Highway Rider are straightforward. 
            The core objective of the player is to cross-timed checkpoints while crossing obstacles between them.
            The game consists of simple controls to move through the screen, and WASD/Arrow Keys to move. 

            The project was designed and developed in UE5 using Blueprints, 
            fulfilling the requirements of the final project for IGME 797: Advanced Topics in Game Development.

        <h2>Processes, Reflections, & References</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;"> In this remake of Highway Rider in Unreal Engine 5, 
            I've created a robust implementation of gameplay mechanics, such as controlling a bike, interacting with the environment, and managing game UI. 
            I used  Blueprints for event handling, player input, and actor spawning provides a fluid gameplay experience. 
            The project includes interactive features such as bike movement with physics integration, item pickups, a dynamic pause menu, and in-game UI elements displaying lives and money. 
            Additionally, I have set up triggers and spawners to manage level transitions, enhancing the game’s flow and ensuring an engaging player experience.
