        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            A remake of the original Highway Rider in UE is an exciting attempt at creating a racing game 
            that puts players in the driver's seat of a high-speed motorcycle. 
            The game mechanics of Highway Rider are straightforward. 
            The core objective of the player is to cross-timed checkpoints while crossing obstacles between them.
            The game consists of simple controls to move through the screen, and WASD/Arrow Keys to move. 

            The project was designed and developed in UE5 using Blueprints, 
            fulfilling the requirements of the final project for IGME 797: Advanced Topics in Game Development.
