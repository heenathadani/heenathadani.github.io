                Gameplay Programmer | UI/UX Designer | VR Developer
            </h2>
            <p>I'm a passionate game developer with a strong foundation in both UI/UX design and gameplay programming.
                My expertise lies in creating immersive experiences that captivate players and enhance gameplay.
                I thrive on the challenge of blending aesthetics with functionality, ensuring that every interaction is seamless and
                engaging. <br>
                From developing full-stack friend list functionality in a multiplayer platformer to implementing leaderboards and
                procedural dungeon generation,
                I bring games to life through intuitive design and robust systems.
                <br>
                Here, you'll find highlights of my work,
                including projects like Matchmaking Systems for multiplayer games,
                Procedural Dungeon Generation for a third person action shooter,
                Collaborating in Mixed Reality for virtual reality applications,
                and various other projects showcasing my skills in UI/UX design, VR simulations, and gameplay mechanics.
